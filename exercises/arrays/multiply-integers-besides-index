# Transform an array such that each index equals the product of the integers of the original array, excluding the original index

Given an array of integers, return a new array such that each element at index i of the new array is the product of all the numbers in the original array except the one at i.

For example, if our input was [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], the expected output would be [120, 60, 40, 30, 24]. If our input was [3, 2, 1], the expected output would be [2, 3, 6].

### MY ANSWER

Includes two higher order methods and requrie division.

Would like to explore a solution not requiring division. 

``` javascript
    const input = [5, 3, 2]

    function doMath(array) {

        let arr = [];
        let product = 1;

        input.forEach(i => {
            product *= i;
        });

        arr = input.map(i => product / i)

        console.log( arr) ;
    }

    doMath(input);
```
